 A-Level OCR Computer Science Programming Project
 
Developer Note

This project is lacking formal documentation.
This project was accompanied by a 50,000 word dissertation on how it works and how it was developed.
However, the file was to large to fit in this repository.
In the future, I will update the documentation of this project and return to fix some issues with the project.
--------------------
Cars learn to navigate around a track using home programmed neural networks and reinforcement learning without using libraries other than default unity libraries.

The main components of this project:
- Physics simulation/Car Physics
- Feed Forward Neural Network
- Reinforcement Learning
- Model Loading/Saving
